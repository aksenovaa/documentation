## TYPO3 на базе Fluid: Form Component Guide

### Foreword

This guide uses concepts and object names which will only be known to you if you have a bit of background Flux knowledge. If you
are looking for a guide describing these concepts, a very good place to start is the [Introduction Chapter](../Introduction.md).
You can of course read this guide without having background knowledge - we have attempted to keep it general and descriptive of
Flux's features - but you will find these explanations much more familiar if you have used Flux at some point in the past. If you
need to dive more into the concept of Flux Forms, [a full Flux Form concept description](../Concepts/FluxForms.md) is available.

Each aspect of the Form Component is explained in broad strokes then rounded off with links to the full API reference (if one
applies) and more importantly the cookbook section dedicated to recipes for various use cases. The way to read this guide is to
read this document first, then continue to recipes which interest you and learn more about how to use the features.

> Note: this guide does not teach you how to use specific implementations of Flux, for example `fluidcontent` and `fluidpages`.
> There are dedicated guides for each of these implementations: this one is for understanding Flux itself - and most importantly
> how and where you can use it to implement TYPO3 forms (TCA, FlexForms) for your own extensions in easier ways.
